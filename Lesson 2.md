### Cybersecurity Architecture: Fundamentals of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability


### Key Learnings
- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to those authorized to view it.
- **Integrity:** Maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle.
- **Availability:** Ensuring that information and resources are available to those who need them when they need them.

### Fundamental Concepts
#### Introduction
- Focus on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) in cybersecurity.

#### Confidentiality
- Accomplished through access control (authentication and authorization).
- Use of technologies like multifactor authentication and role-based access control.
- Encryption to ensure that only authorized users can access the data.

#### Integrity
- Ensuring data remains unchanged and true to itself.
- Use of cryptographic functions like digital signatures and message authentication codes.
- Example of blockchain technology for immutable record-keeping.

#### Availability
- Ensuring resources are available to authorized users when needed.
- Protection against denial of service (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.
- Techniques to handle overwhelming traffic and preserve system availability.
