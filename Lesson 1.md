# Cybersecurity Architecture: Five Principles to Follow (and One to Avoid)

## Key Learnings
- **Defense in Depth**: Implementing multiple layers of security to create a challenging obstacle for potential attackers.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Granting minimal access rights for users, only as much as necessary to perform their job.
- **Separation of Duties**: Ensuring no single point of control and requiring collusion for a security breach.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Introduction
- Importance of cybersecurity architecture in protecting against hackers.
- Focus on fundamentals and various cybersecurity domains.

### Defense in Depth
- Creating a multi-layered defense system, akin to an obstacle course.
- Modern examples include:
  - Multi-factor authentication
  - Mobile device management
  - Endpoint detection and response
  - Firewalls
  - Vulnerability testing
  - Data encryption

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Access rights should be minimal and justified.
- Emphasizes system hardening and avoiding privilege creep.
- Regular re-certification of access rights.

### Separation of Duties
- Preventing single points of control.
- Physical and IT examples demonstrate the necessity for collaboration in access or control.

### Secure by Design
- Security should be integral, starting from the design phase.
- All stages of project development should include security considerations.

### K.I.S.S. Principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Balancing complexity to deter attackers without overburdening legitimate users.
- Example: Password rules that are complex for security but manageable for users.

### Security by Obscurity (Avoid)
- Avoiding reliance on secrecy as a security measure.
- Emphasizing transparent and observable security methods.
